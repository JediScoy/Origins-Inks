VAR AboutKepler =   "Johannes Kepler, assistant and student of Tycho Brahe. He has used his teacher's extensive collection of astronomical records to develop three laws of planetary motion. He believes in the Copernican model of the universe, although he found it difficult to fit Tycho's observations of Mars into the model with a circular orbit. He therefore used the idea of elliptical orbits to describe the motions of the planets, which became known as Kepler's first law. His second law states that a line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time. The third law was a masterpiece of simplicity: the square of the number of years of a planet's orbital period is equal to the cube of that planet's average distance from the Sun."

VAR WorldSetting           = "This story takes place in \"Regio Scientiae: A Land of Understanding.\" Its a world of magic and steampunk. The story is a Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) which means You are an reader and active Player in story. The narratives can be done solo, but they are best experienced the first time as playful interaction with the Master Scoy (game master and teacher) and other real life Players (your classmates). NOTE: I do my best to make it functional and interesting, but if you encounter dead ends or have story suggestions - let me know!"
