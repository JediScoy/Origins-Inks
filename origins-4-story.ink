- {Maid}: "Welcome weary adventurers!"
- Your party is greeted with a {~ warm| big| kind} smile from {Maid} at The Blue Mug inn.
- You: "We grow {~bored|tired} of town life."
    + "What news do you have?"
- (season_hook) // SEASON HOOK
- {Maid}: "If I recall, you wanted your next quest to be on or near water?"
- You: 
    + "Yes."
- {Maid}: 
- <> "The merfolk are causing problems on the Sea of Falling Stars for passing ships. 
- <> "The weather around {lake3} has been highly unusual and erratic."
- You:
    + "Can you tell us more about the merfolk?"
        -- {Maid}: "I think it might have involved politics amongst the merfolk. Perhaps there are outside forces at play? You'd have to travel to Watersdeep to get more details."
        -- {TheWizard}: "This sounds like an interesting quest to explore. However, I don't think its inline with the objectives of our new 'friend' we're helping.
         --You:
            ++ "Agreed. ->quest4
    + (quest4) Do you know anything else about the unusual weather around {lake3}?"
        -- {TheWizard}: “For that matter, do we even know what regulates 'normal' weather and climate?”
        -- {TheCleric}: "I admit I don't know much about weather and climate. Farmers usually make good predictions because of their years of previous experience. If things are changing though that's going to cause all sorts of problems."
- You:
    + "{~Hmm|Interesting|Indeed}."
- {Maid}: "The weather in previous seasons have been more extreme in general. Some attribute the stranger things at {lake3} to powerful water elementals that've been called forth. "
- You:
    + "I think this is the quest to pursue."
        
        //-- {TheFighter}: "Definitely want to avoid that place then."
        //-- You: face palm
          //  ++ "We are actually looking for water-related adventures."
    //+ "Do you have more to information about the weather complaints?"
    //    -- {Maid}: "Sorry, not really."
    //    -- {TheCleric}: "We are looking for a water adventure. Weather and water are DEFINITELY related to each other, but I think we should first focus on acquiring (getting) that item that our new 'friend' has requested." Rubs chin thinking.
    //    --You:
    //        ++ "Agreed."

// - {TheFighter}: "Oh right."

// - {TheWizard}: "Hmm. We might also try a Potion of Water Breathing"
- You leave for {lake3}.
