The story is a Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) which means You are an reader and active Player in story. The narratives can be done solo, but they are best experienced the first time as playful interaction with the Master Scoy (game master and teacher) and other real life Players (your classmates).

He believes in the Copernican model of the universe, although he found it difficult to fit Tycho's observations of Mars into the model with a circular orbit. He used the idea of elliptical orbits to describe the motions of the planets, which became known as Kepler's first law. His second law states that a line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time which basically means as orbiting objects like planets get closer to the sun they speed up and when farther away they go slower. Later, the third law was developed: the square of the number of years of a planet's orbital period is equal to the cube of that planet's average distance from the Sun.","/str",{"VAR=":"KeplerAbout"},"str","^(1) The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
