He therefore used the idea of elliptical orbits to describe the motions of the planets, which became known as Kepler's first law. His second law states that a line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time. The third law was a masterpiece of simplicity: the square of the number of years of a planet's orbital period is equal to the cube of that planet's average distance from the Sun.","/str",{"VAR=":"KeplerAbout"},"str","^Father of Modern Geology, contributed to principle of uniformitarianism which stated that planet's processes today are similar to those of the past.
