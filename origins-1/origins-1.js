His observatory contains sophisticated equipment for mapping star positions, and for more than 20 years he made detailed records of his findings. He believes that the universe is a blend of the Ptolemaic and Copernican models, and created his own model in which the planets orbit the Sun and the Sun orbits the Earth.","/str",{"VAR=":"BraheAbout"},"str","^Johannes Kepler, assistant and student of Tycho Brahe. He has used his teacher's extensive collection of astronomical records to develop three laws of planetary motion. He believes in the Copernican model of the universe, although he found it difficult to fit Tycho's observations of Mars into the model with a circular orbit. He therefore used the idea of elliptical orbits to describe the motions of the planets, which became known as Kepler's first law. His second law states that a line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time. The third law was a masterpiece of simplicity: the square of the number of years of a planet's orbital period is equal to the cube of that planet's average distance from the Sun.","/str",{"VAR=":"KeplerAbout"},"str","^BANDIT AC: 12 HP: 11","/str",{"VAR=":"BanditStats"},"str","^SCIMITAR +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
